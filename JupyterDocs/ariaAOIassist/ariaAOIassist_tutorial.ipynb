    "# Creating a new Area of Interest\n",
    "**Author** Robert Zinke, Simran Sangha, David Bekaert - Jet Propulsion Laboratory\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates suggested practices for creating a new study area of interest (AOI) for Sentinel-1 acquisitions. This is done by browsing products available through the [Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF) Data Search Vertex](https://search.asf.alaska.edu/#/) site. Below, we demonstrate the AOI selection process using the **`ariaAOIassist.py`** function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of creating a new AOI follows the general workflow:\n",
    "1. Download metadata from ASF Vertex\n",
    "2. Extract the data coverage using the ariaAOIassist.py function\n",
    "3. Filter results and determine the best processing strategy that weighs InSAR coverage in time and space\n",
    "4. Precisely define the AOI as a polygon in Google Earth, being certain to trim the polygon edges by approximately one burst or ~20 km\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: Creating a new AOI is often an iterative process and particular attention should be paid to ensuring the final AOI bounds are within the area of coverage. The `ariaAOIassist.py` function cannot ensure the creation of an exact AOI that meets all criteria, but is designed the help the user in determining the best strategy for processing. Contact xxx@jpl.nasa.gov for assistance."
